Problem 1: Vectors (AKA C++ ArrayLists...)
Say we are writing the next version of a nifty new mail reading program and want to use a Vector (interface in reader appendix) to store all the data. The following structure is used to hold the data of an email message:
struct eMailMsg {
string to;
string from;
string message;
string subject;
int date;
int time;
a) How would you declare a Vector that stores eMailMsgs?
b) Write a function RemoveSpam that takes a vector containing elements of type eMailMsg and removes all elements whose subject begins with the string "SPAM".
c) How could you modify the to field of the eMailMsg structure so that it can hold the email addresses of an arbitrary number of recipients of an email? With the modification in place, given an eMailMsg email, how would you access the last address listed in the to field?
