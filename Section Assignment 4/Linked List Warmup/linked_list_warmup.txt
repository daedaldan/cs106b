Problem 4: Linked List Warmup
Write the following linked list functions. Provide both iterative and a recursive
forumlations. Cell is defined as follows:
struct Cell {
Cell *next;
int value;
};
a) Write a function ConvertToList which takes in a Vector of ints and converts it into a
linked list. Assume the Vector has at least one element in it.
Cell * ConvertToList(Vector<int> vector)
b) Write a function which sums the values of a linked list.
int SumList(Cell *list)
