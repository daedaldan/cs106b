Problem 1: Removing all occurrences of characters
Write a function CensorString that takes two strings as input and returns the first string with all of the characters that are present in the second removed.
"Stanford University" with “nt” removed becomes "Saford Uiversiy" "Llamas like to laugh" with “la” removed becomes "Lms ike to ugh" and so on . . .
Note that the function is case sensitive. This function could be written two ways. One way is to return a completely new string, and the other is to modify the original string. For practice write both of these functions. First write a function that returns a completely new string with the following prototype:
string CensorString1(string text, string remove);
and then write a function that modifies the original string with the following prototype:
void CensorString2(string & text, string remove);
