Problem 3: Vectors
Write a function CountLetters that takes a filename and prints the number of times each letter of the alphabet appears in that file. Because there are 26 numbers to be printed, CountLetters needs to create a Vector. For example, if the file is:
Abcd K.. ijk;; cab-Bage fad
CountLetters should print the following:
a: 4
b: 3
c: 2
d: 2
... z: 0
When you really print this out, it should be 26 elements long, but we couldn't easily display that on the page. Note that there may be upper case letters, lower case letters, and non-letter characters in the file. All letters should be counted regardless of case (so “Aa” is two a’s), and non-alphabetic characters should be ignored. You should use the following prototype.
void CountLetters(string filename);
