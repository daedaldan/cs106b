Problem 1: Client-side vs. Implementation-side
Consider a basic Stack class built on top of a Vector:
template <typename Type>
class Stack {
public:
Stack();
~Stack();
void push(Type elem);
Type pop();
bool isEmpty();
private:
Vector<Type> elems;
}
a) Say we as the implementers want to add a method that will reverse the elements that are currently in the Stack. How can we do it?
b) Now write another Reverse function, this time as a client of the stack class.
