Problem 4: Cannonballs
Suppose that you have somehow been transported back to 1777 and the Revolutionary War. You have been assigned a dangerous reconnaissance mission: evaluate the amount of ammunition available to the British for use with their large cannon which has been shelling the Revolutionary forces. Fortunately for you, the British—being neat and orderly—have stacked the cannonballs into a single pyramid-shaped stack with one cannonball at the top, sitting on top of a square composed of four cannonballs, sitting on top of a square composed of nine cannonballs, and so forth. Unfortunately, however, the Redcoats are also vigilant, and you only have time to count the number of layers in the pyramid before you are able to escape back to your own troops. To make matters worse, computers will not be invented for at least 150 years, but you should not let that detail get in your way. Your mission is to write a recursive function Cannonball that takes as its argument the height of the pyramid and returns the number of cannonballs therein.
int Cannonball(int height);
