Problem 8: List Mnemonics
On the standard Touch-ToneTM telephone dial, the digits are mapped onto the alphabet (minus the letters Q and Z) as shown in the diagram below:
In order to make their phone numbers more memorable, service providers like to find numbers that spell out some word (called a mnemonic) appropriate to their business that makes that phone number easier to remember. For example, the phone number for a recorded time-of-day message in some localities is 637-8687 (NERVOUS).
Imagine that you have just been hired by a local telephone company to write a function ListMnemonics that will generate all possible letter combinations that correspond to a given number, represented as a string of digits. For example, if you call ListMnemonics("723") your program should generate the following 27 possible letter combinations that correspond to that prefix:
PAD PBD PCD RAD RBD RCD SAD SBD SCD
PAE PBE PCE RAE RBE RCE SAE SBE SCE
PAF PBF PCF RAF RBF RCF SAF SBF SCF
The function declaration is listed below:
void ListMnemonics(string str);
